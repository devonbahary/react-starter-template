# React Starter Template
React starter template created for forking in future projects. I appreciated the practicality of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but I wanted to be able to create a React project from scratch and get the gist of all its ingredients.

(development) localhost:8080
`npm run dev-server`

(production) localhost:3000 `npm start`

**Features**:
 - React Router
 - SASS
 - [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
 - Webpack configured for **development** and **production**
 - **Node.js Express** server
 - babel plugins
  - [class properties transform](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/)
  - [object rest spread transform](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-object-rest-spread/)

This project aims to include further dependencies/configuration in the future to contribute to a more useful, **minimalist React template**!
